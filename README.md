## üöÄ Get started

### For Juli Users

Inbox MCP brings intelligent email management to your Juli experience. Once installed from Juli's MCP marketplace, you'll be guided through a simple setup process to connect your email account. Your credentials are stored securely by Juli - you only need to set them up once.

### For MCP Developers

1. **Clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inbox-mcp.git
cd inbox-mcp
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

3. **Build and start the server:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The HTTP server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file).

### API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /mcp/tools` - List available tools
- `POST /mcp/tools/:toolName` - Execute a tool
- `GET /mcp/needs-setup` - Check if setup is required

### Authentication

Nylas credentials are passed via HTTP headers on each request:
- `X-User-Credential-NYLAS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `X-User-Credential-NYLAS_GRANT_ID`

Juli handles this automatically. For direct API usage, include these headers in your requests.
